# The Professional Portfolio of Dannielle Taylor

As a future front end web developer & designer, I have successfully been able to take my creativity from educational information mapping, course creation, cake design and training facilitation to begin forging a new career path that will allow me to highlight my passion for problem solving & design.

Although web development is a new career choice, I have always had the drive to think outside the box. With a certificate in front end development from Vanderbilt University, my skills in UI/UX design will allow me to forge new professional paths

I am now searching for opportunities to focus the wide range skills learned, towards pushing the limits as a designer and while infusing each design with creativity and beauty.
